# risk-of-risk
Monte Carlo simulations for assessing the risks in the board game "risk" 

# TODO
* [X] Max N-dice roll distribution for N: 1-3
* [X] How many attacking armies you need to win the battle (as a function of opponent size) 
* [ ] Joint max distribution for a pair of Ns 
* [ ] Successful attack/defense probability
* [ ] Expected value of remaining troops
